# Employee-Directory-reaction

# Background
In this application you can view all the employees of your company. You can view a certain employee by name, age, email, and phone number. The app will allow you(user) to sort by columns and search typing in the searchbar. This was a challenging assignment from bootcamp. I wouldn't have gotten it done without help from classmates and support from the web.

# UserStory
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
