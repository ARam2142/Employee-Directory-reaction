# Employee-Directory-reaction

# Background
In this application you can view all the employees of your company. You can view a certain employee by name, age, email, and phone number. This should have the functionality to sort and filter by category. I will work on it when I understand react better and learn to code the logic required. This was very challenging.

# UserStory
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

# Technologies
Javascript

HTML

CSS

React JS
